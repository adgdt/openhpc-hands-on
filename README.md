# OpenHPC hands-on

This repository stores materials for the OpenHPC hands-on workshop.

Document `speed-run.txt` is a simplified, strongly-summarized version of the official OpenHPC guide, including some reordering for pedagogical purpose. Its aim is to help to instruct a "hands-on" OpenHPC installation workshop, being made of just commands and short comments. It is not intended in anyway to replace official documentation neither recommended for production systems.
The idea is that the attenders to the workshop having a copy of this `speed-run.txt` file, can copy-paste commands within the file, following Instructor instructions.

I also recommend IAMC's (https://github.com/iamc/nasertic-HPC-ansible) `03-vagrant-OpenHPC-bare` Vagrant file for VirtualBox, to speed up and make easier the deploy of VMs for the base infrastructure needed in a "hands-on" for the installation of OpenHPC making use of `speed-run.txt` document.
